### **AMII ML I Technician Capstone**  

This course's learning objectives are to develop ML knowledge to define and execute a machine learning project that supports an organization's business priorities.   
Throughout the 13-weeks, concepts were introduced and reinforced through a combination of lectures, labs, and assignments. The capstone project was a 30 minute ML business case presentation to a panel of ML and industry experts.  
Unlike most ML courses and programs, this course's focus was on defining a business case for ML and how ML can add value to an organization.  
Students had a choice between two Kaggle datasets to work on for the capstone presentation. In this instance, the Nasa Turbofan dataset was selected.  
Each week, a lab was designed to reinforce the lecture materials and incrementally build up the knowledge and skills required to showcase an ML solution for the selected dataset.
